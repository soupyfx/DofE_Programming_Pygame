# Week Three
Today I leared how to use the pygame sprite class to allow me to make sprites and create functions for the sprite classes (These may seem uselsess but they allow me to
make my code alot more tidy and improve efficiency in my code)

BTW The code you see is a game based of the game I saw in the youtube video I thaught it would be easyer to learn if I watched the video and then tried recreating it
because it is a difficult thing to rap your head around.
