# Week One
So today I made a small game in pygame its a game where you have to dodge planets (I know so orignal) and the game looks really ugly and has like no sound but it worked and only took me 6 or so hours over 2 days

Also there are a lot less comments because there is no need for them (I still tried to add them where I could)

# Infomation
## Inprovemens (What would I improve about the game)

- Add textures
- Add sounds
- Add a diffultly slider
- Make it so you can change the size of the frame (I would add this but I have no clue how to)

## Resources Used (Like docs and youtube videos)
